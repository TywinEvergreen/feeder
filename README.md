Feeder project
================
**Feeder** is a tool that helps you track the latest releases from different resources by aggregating such contents as albums from *Spotify* and videos from *Youtube* into one single feed.


## *Then how does it work?*
Everything is as simple as possible! All you have to do is:
1. Register a new Feeder account
2. Link Spotify/Google to your Feeder account or manually add channels/artists you'd like to get notifications about
3. Start receiving notifications
